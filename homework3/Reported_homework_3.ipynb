    "From theory we know that the best strategy to make an optimized table in BigQuery so that we always order the results by PUlocationID and filter based on lpep_pickup_datetime is `Creating partition by lpep_pickup_datetime Cluster on PUlocationID`. Indeed, knowing that partitioning is allowed over one column only; hence, using the column _lpep_pickup_datetime_ to create a date column will effectively reduce the number of rows to be analized in future queries. Using PULocationID to create partitions will reduce the results to a limited number of IDs instead of listing all of them in a specific order, which is the desired outcome. \n",
